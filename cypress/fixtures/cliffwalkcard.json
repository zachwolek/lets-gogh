        "short_description": "In the 1880s, Monet went to paint in Normandy and became increasingly enamored of his surroundings. He wrote to his second wife and her children: \"How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!\" Eventually they joined him in Pourville. The two young women strolling here are probably the eldest daughters.",
