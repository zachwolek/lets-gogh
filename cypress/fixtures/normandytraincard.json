        "short_description": "The Impressionists frequently paid tribute to the modern aspects of Paris, depicting scenes of grand boulevards and modern constructions. Monet made 12 paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare. Here, he focused on the glass-and-iron train shed, where he found an appealing combination of artificial and natural effects: the rising steam of locomotives trapped within the structure and daylight penetrating the large, glazed sections of the roof.",
