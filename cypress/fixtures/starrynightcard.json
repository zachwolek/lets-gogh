        "short_description": "Alma Thomas was enthralled by astronauts and outer space. This painting, made when she was 81, showcases that fascination through her signature style of short, rhythmic strokes of paint. “Color is life, and light is the mother of color,” she once proclaimed. In 1972, she became the first African American woman to have a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.",
