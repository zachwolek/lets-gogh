        "short_description": "Seated in a posture called the lotus, this serene 12th-century Buddha rests his hands and feet atop one another as he gazes downward, his eyelids lowered, the touch of a smile on his lips. The symbols that distinguish him as a great being—such as the <em>urna</em> on his forehead and <em>ushnisha</em> on top of his head—are delicately carved in the hard granite.",
